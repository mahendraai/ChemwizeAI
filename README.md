Quantum-Enhanced Retrosynthesis with Bayesian Optimization by Phytoz-ai.com for custom development Mo.+919726359459
Qiskit with Bayesian Optimization (BO) for quantum-enhanced retrosynthesis is a powerful idea for drug discovery and chemical process design. Here's how this can be structured:

ðŸ”¬ Goal:
Optimize retrosynthetic pathways using quantum algorithms (via Qiskit) and guide the search intelligently using Bayesian Optimization.

ðŸ§ª Problem Overview
Retrosynthesis:
Given a target molecule, break it down into simpler precursor molecules using known reaction rules.

Challenges:
Huge search space (combinatorial explosion).
Multiple objectives (yield, cost, safety).
Uncertainty in reaction outcomes.

ðŸ”§ Architecture
1. Search Space Definition
Each retrosynthetic pathway is a sequence of reactions:

Input features (X): Reaction templates, precursor molecule graphs, reaction steps.

Objective (Y): Cost, probability of success, number of steps, quantum-evaluated reward.


# Quantum-Enhanced Retrosynthesis with Bayesian Optimization by Phytoz-ai.com for custom development Mo.+919726359459

This repo demonstrates a hybrid AI + quantum computing approach to retrosynthetic pathway discovery. It combines:

- Qiskit (QAOA) for quantum evaluation
- RDKit for retrosynthesis and molecule parsing
- BoTorch + GPyTorch for Bayesian Optimization

## Use Case
Optimize retrosynthetic routes for target molecules by:
- Generating reaction pathways using RDKit
- Encoding them into QUBO (combinatorial cost)
- Evaluating pathway score with Qiskit (QAOA)
- Guiding exploration via Bayesian Optimization
