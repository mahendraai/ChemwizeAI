Qiskit with Bayesian Optimization (BO) for quantum-enhanced retrosynthesis is a powerful idea for drug discovery and chemical process design. Here's how this can be structured:

ðŸ”¬ Goal:
Optimize retrosynthetic pathways using quantum algorithms (via Qiskit) and guide the search intelligently using Bayesian Optimization.

ðŸ§ª Problem Overview
Retrosynthesis:
Given a target molecule, break it down into simpler precursor molecules using known reaction rules.

Challenges:

Huge search space (combinatorial explosion).

Multiple objectives (yield, cost, safety).

Uncertainty in reaction outcomes.

ðŸ”§ Architecture
1. Search Space Definition
Each retrosynthetic pathway is a sequence of reactions:

Input features (X): Reaction templates, precursor molecule graphs, reaction steps.

Objective (Y): Cost, probability of success, number of steps, quantum-evaluated reward.
